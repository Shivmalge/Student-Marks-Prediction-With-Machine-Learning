# Student-Marks-Prediction-With-Machine-Learning

## I have some information about students like:

### 1. the number of courses they have opted for
### 2. the average time studied per day by students
### 3. marks obtained by students

## 1. The effect of number of courses on the marks of a student by scattering the plot

### According to the above data visualization, we can say that the number of courses may not affect the marks of a student if the student is studying for more time daily

## 2.The relationship between the time a studied daily and the marks scored by the student

### We can see that there is a linear relationship between the time studied and the marks obtained. This means the more time students spend studying, the better they can score.

## 3. I found the correlation between the marks scored by the students and the other two columns in the data.

### So the time_studied column is more correlated with the marks column than the other column.

## 4. The I splitted the dataset into training and testing.

## 5. SO , I trained the Model using LinearRegression algorithm.

## 6. So lastly I have given input values as time_study and number_courses and predicted the output as Marks of the Student.

## So this is how you can predict the marks of a student with machine learning using Python.

## Summary:

### So this is how I have solved the problem of student marks prediction with machine learning. It is a good regression problem as it easy to solve and understand.
